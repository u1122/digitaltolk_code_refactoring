The over coding stucture need to be more precise and effective. Multiple things that need to be suggested  and imporove on the basis of coding schemes.
1) The code was not chunked properly.
2) Code was bulky and one file having large number of raw coding.
3) Formating was not properly as only some of the files were provided that wasn't clear enough.
4) I per my knowledge the code wasn't used the orignal usage of Laravel schemes.
5) As per my observation most of the static concepts were involed that is not a good approach.
6) Code was repeated statically rather then use re-usability.
7) Eloquent Model concpects were very limited only contoller was on sake for everything.
8) Restructuring of the code much needed.
9) Raw logics was mostly used.
10) Lengthy code without being structured not making much sense

Suggestions
1) Over stucture should be improved.
2) Rather functional based approached should be used.
3) Rather than bulking the controller and sub-file reuse functions should be used.
4) Helper functional should be generic as most of the functions are doing same things.
5) API's, Web API's and Mobile API's should be deal differently and flow based things should used.
6) Same functions in the model should be conditional based.
7) Code should be provided with the scenerio and some of the chunks should be provided like puzzel will help a lot to solve the problems and easily understandable.
